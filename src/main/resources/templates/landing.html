          <p>
            At Credit-O-Cube, our journey began in April 2024, when Timothy Chai, Pranay Nalawade, Morella Paciencia,
            Tanay Rishi and Wong Mann Joe joined forces with a shared vision to revolutionize the credit industry. With
            a deep understanding of the challenges individuals face in accessing financial services, our founders set
            out to create a company that would empower people with transparent, accessible credit solutions. Since our
            inception, we've remained steadfast in our commitment to integrity, innovation, and customer-centricity,
            guided by the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to achieve their financial goals. Today,
            Credit-O-Cube continues to thrive under the leadership of our founders, driving positive change and making a
            meaningful impact in the lives of our customers and communities.
